# Biography

Dr. Prajjwal Panday joined Nichols College as Assistant Professor of Environmental Science in the Fall of 2016. He is a broadly trained geographer with expertise in environmental modeling, hydro-climatology, remote sensing, and geospatial technologies. His research and intellectual interests focused on using a systems approach to determine linkages between climate variability, anthropogenic changes, and land-water interactions. His research utilizes field-based observations, satellite remote sensing, geospatial data, and process-based modeling to understand terrestrial and hydrological processes across various spatial and temporal scales. Much of his work thus far has focused on the monitoring and modeling of various components of the hydrological cycle in some of the fastest changing regions of the world such as the Himalayas as well as the Amazon.
